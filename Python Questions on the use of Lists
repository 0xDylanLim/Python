Write a Python program to sum all the items in a list:
def sum_list(items):
  sum_numbers=0
  for x in items:
    sum_numbers += x
  return sum_numbers

print(sum_list([1,2,-8]))


Write a Python program to multiply all the items in a list:
def mult_list(items):
  mult = 1
  for x in items:
    mult *= x
  return mult

print(mult_list([1,3,5]))


Write a Python program to get the largest number from a list:
def large(list):
  max = list[0]
  for a in list:
    if a > max:
      max = a
  return max
  
print(large([1,3,65,7,8]))

Write a Python program to get the smallest number from a list:

def small(list):
  small = list[0]
  for a in list:
    if a < small:
      small = a
  return small
  
print(small([8,3,65,7,8]))

Write a Python program to count the number of strings from a given list of strings. The string length is 2 or more and the first and last characters are the same:
def match(words):
  count = 0
  for word in words:
    if len(word) >= 2 and word[0] == word[-1]:
      count += 1
  return count 

print(match(['abc', 'xyz', 'aba', '1221']))

Write a Python program to get a list, sorted in increasing order by the last element in each tuple from a given list of non-empty tuples:
def last(n):
  return n[-1]

def sort(tuples):
  return sorted(tuples, key=last)

Check a list is empty or not:
l = []
if not l:
  print("List is empty")
